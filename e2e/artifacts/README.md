# Contract Artifacts

This folder contains any required artifacts used for the e2e tests.

### Chainlink Solana

Currently the recommened way to access compiled artifacts for solana
is to compile them locally. We included the `solana/` folder with the
required artifacts for compiling and deploying the MCMS and timelock
contracts.
