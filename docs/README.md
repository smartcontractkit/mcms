# MCMS Library

## Motivation

The **Go-MCMS Library** is designed to provide a product-agnostic, cross-chain multisig platform
that addresses the need for standardized, secure, and scalable multisig operations across
different product teams. The motivation for building this platform stems from the need for consistency
in how teams manage their product lifecycle, particularly in terms of deploying and securing their
contracts using multisig across various ownership models.

MCMS (ManyChainMultisig System) addresses this challenge by providing a
standardized interface that facilitates scalable multisig operations across
multiple chains.

The library offers tools to deploy and manage multisig setups while ensuring cross-product interoperability,
scalability, and security. By leveraging the MCMS library, product teams can focus on their core protocols and products
without needing to reinvent their multisig management processes.

## Key Features:

* **Contract Management Across Chains:** MCMS simplifies contract management by allowing users to send a set of
  transactions to multiple chains using a single set of signatures. This cross-chain capability enables teams to
  streamline operations, reducing the complexity and overhead involved in managing contract security across multiple
  blockchains.
* **Security:** Ensure the security of products and users by defending against various attack vectors.
* **Product Agnosticism:** Provide a platform that integrates seamlessly with various products and protocols without
  product-specific modifications.
* **Cross-Chain Interoperability:** Standardize multisig operations across multiple chains, allowing product teams to
  expand to new chains easily. MCMS makes it possible to execute the same set of operations on different chains with
  minimal additional configuration.
* **Proposal Generation:** The library allows users to generates valid MCMS proposals with transaction to manage and
  configure their product-specific smart contracts.
* **Proposal simulation**: Proposals can be simulated locally before sending them on chain. This allows to catch issues
  with the transactions.
* **Proposal Execution**: Proposal are sent on-chain for execution across multiple chains.
* **Proposal Inspection**: Proposals can be presented in formats that are more human friendly to facilitate reviews and
  collaboration.
